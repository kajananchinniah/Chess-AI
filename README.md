# Chess AI

A cleaner version of my previous chess ai (that has since been privated)
It seems to be slower than my old version for some reason (I might have messed up rewriting it). 

To do if I pursue this again:
- Clean the play_chess file 
- Implement in C
- Implement a check & checkmate system & detecting if someone won/lost 
- Implement alpha beta pruning to increase depth
- Implement promotion, castling, en passant, and the ability to move a pawn by two squares on the first turn
